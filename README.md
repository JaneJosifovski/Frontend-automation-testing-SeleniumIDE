# SeleniumIDE QA Portfolio

Welcome to my SeleniumIDE QA Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of automation scripts for web testing (frontend) that I have created using SeleniumIDE. The scripts are designed to test both small and large platforms.

## Introduction

As a Quality Assurance tester, I am always looking for ways to improve my testing skills and make the testing process more efficient. That's why I started using SeleniumIDE to generate automation scripts for web testing. The scripts in this portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in using SeleniumIDE to test a variety of web applications. To test out these tests you would need SeleniumIDE (an extention for Chrome and Firefox), or go with the longer route by using an IDE with lauching Selenium and etc.

## Getting Started

To get started, I suggest reviewing the files in this repository to get an idea of the types of automation scripts I have created using SeleniumIDE.

## Conclusion

This repository is a record of my proficiency in using SeleniumIDE to create automation scripts for web testing. I am excited to share my work with others and hope that it can be used as a reference for others who are interested in using SeleniumIDE for web testing. Thank you for visiting my repository!
