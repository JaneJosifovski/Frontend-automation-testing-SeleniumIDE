# SeleniumIDE QA Portfolio

Welcome to my SeleniumIDE/CypressRecorder/KatalonRecorder QA Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of automation scripts for web testing (frontend) that I have created using SeleniumIDE, Cypress Recorder and KatalonRecorder. The scripts are designed to test both small and large platforms.

## Introduction

As a Quality Assurance tester, I am always looking for ways to improve my testing skills and make the testing process more efficient. That's why I started using SeleniumIDE to generate automation scripts for web testing. The scripts in this portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in using SeleniumIDE to test a variety of web applications. To test out these tests you would need SeleniumIDE, Cypress Recorder and KatalonRecorder (extentions for Chrome and Firefox), or go with the longer route by using an IDE with lauching Selenium or Cypress or Katalon Studio and etc.

## Getting Started
