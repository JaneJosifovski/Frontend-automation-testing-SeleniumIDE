# QA-testing-SeleniumIDE
Scripts written with Selenium IDE whilst testing different kinds of websites and platforms.
This serves to show my progress in starting and learning Selenium IDE, paving the way for my future moving forward to Selenium by writing my own automation scripts.
And this will help me strenghten my manual testing, to give me an edge in somewhat of a semi-automation testing script and etc.
